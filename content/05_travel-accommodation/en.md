## Getting to Brasília

[Brasília International Airport Juscelino Kubitschek (BSB)](http://www.bsb.aero/en/) is a major hub for travel within Brazil, so there are numerous flights that go through the city's airport every day. On the other hand, despite being a major capital, there are just few international non-stop flights directly to Brasilia, from: Buenos Aires (Aerolineas Argentinas), Lisbon (TAP Portugal), Miami (LATAM and American Airlines), Orlando (TAM), Panama City (COPA) and Paris (Air France).

If you are not flying directly to Brasilia you will probably book a flight to São Paulo, Guarulhos Airport  (GRU) or Rio de Janeiro, Galeão Airport (GIG) - those are the main international entrances to Brazil. In both cases, you will have to go through Brazilian customs and immigration on the arriving airport and re-board in a domestic flight to Brasilia. While booking your flight to São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, please make sure that your domestic flight to Brasilia will departure from the same airport. Both cities have also have a domestic airport and getting there from the internationals ones would take an unnecessary time.

## Tourist information

### The City

Open in 1960, Brasilia and the Federal District were created to house the new capital of Brazil replacing Rio de Janeiro.  Under the visionary leadership of President Juscelino Kubitschek, architect Oscar Niemeyer, urban planner Lucio Costa and landscape architect Burle Marx, Brasilia was conceived as a workable, utopic answer to modern, urban chaos.  .

The purpose-built city is lauded by many for its futuristic architecture and avant-garde design and it is the  the first in the world constructed in the 20th century to achieve World Cultural Heritage designation by UNESCO.

Its modern architecture and harmonious contrast between green vegetation and concrete make Brasilia a unique city and destination. The main Niemeyer´s attractions are the National Congress, the Planalto Palace, the Justice Palace, the Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasilia and the TV Tower. Other prominent places in the city are the Lady Sarah Kubitschek City Park and the Paranoá Lake.

### The Nature

Located in the heart of Brazil, Brasilia is surrounded by the Cerrado biome, which guards unbelievable natural beauties. The Cerrado is the world’s most biologically rich savanna. It has over 10,000 species of plants, of which 45% are exclusive to the Cerrado, and it stretches across nearly 500 million acres of Brazil — an area nearly three times the size of Texas. The Cerrado also feeds three of the major water basins in South America: the Amazon, Paraguay and São Francisco Rivers.

The Cerrado is home to 935 species of birds and nearly 300 mammals, including such endangered species as: cerrado fox, giant anteater, jaguar and maned wolf. Scientists estimate that the Cerrado harbors as many as 10,000 species of vascular plants. More than 400 tree and shrub species are unique to the region.

The climate is dry and the trees are twisted. During the day, it’s hot, but at night, the cold weather is pleasant. The Cerrado is without doubt one of the most beautiful Brazilian biomes. For those who like to be in contact with nature, the Chapada dos Veadeiros and the city of Pirenópolis are two must-see refuges near by Brasília.
