## Getting to Brasília

<a href="http://www.bsb.aero/en/" target="_blank">Brasília International Airport Juscelino Kubitschek (BSB)</a> is a major hub for travel within Brazil and services numerous flights every day. However, unlike other capital cities, only a few international airports offer non-stop flights travel directly to Brasília:
+ Buenos Aires (Aerolineas Argentinas)
+ Lisbon (TAP Portugal)
+ Miami (LATAM and American Airlines)
+ Orlando (TAM)
+ Panama City (COPA)
+ Paris (Air France)

Those not flying directly to Brasília will probably travel through São Paulo, Guarulhos Airport (GRU) or Rio de Janeiro, Galeão Airport (GIG), the main international entrances to Brazil. In both of these airports, travellers will have to pass through Brazilian customs and immigration on arrival and then re-board in a domestic flight to Brasília. 

When booking flights to São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, please make sure that your domestic flight to Brasilia departs from the same airport. Both cities have domestic airports, and traveling between the international and domestic ones will add unnecessary travel time.

### Language

Portuguese is the official language of Brazil. Many Brazilians in the larger cities — especially those you encounter working at airports, hotels, better restaurants, tour companies and travel agencies — speak at least some English. Both English and Spanish are taught in many Brazilian schools.

### Money procedures

The unit of currency in Brazil is the real and the plural is reais. The real further divides into 100 centavos. The symbol for real is "R$" and the currency code is BRL. Other currencies, such as USD, are barely accepted in Brazil. So you need to have Reais in your wallet!

+ Change Money: You can exchange money in banks or in currency exchanges located at the Brasilia Airport. Hotels and travel agencies may also exchange money for you; 
+ Credit and Debit Cards: Visa and MasterCard are widely accepted in Brazil. American Express and Diners Club, are often accepted as well;
+ ATMs:  ATM’s are located all over the country, including Brasilia Airport. However, there may be limits to the daily amount that you can withdraw from an ATM, specially from 10:00pm to 6:00 am.

### Personal security

According to Brazilian security authorities, Brasília’s “Plano Piloto” (central area of town) is considered as a safe area. Nevertheless precautions should be taken and it is advisable to practice the same caution you would practice when visiting a major metropolitan destination in any country. Consider the caution you take at night in any major city and use the same caution when in Brasília:
+	Expensive cameras and jewelry should be worn discreetly;
+	Purses and wallets can attract attention:
+	Only carry small amounts of cash and a copy of your passport. Carry only the credit cards you are going to need, not all you have. 
+	When using ATMs do it at commercial hours and prefer the ATMs located inside banks, shopping malls or supermarkets.

### Telecommunication and internet

Brazil has an extensive fixed and mobile phone systems which will allow you to call anywhere in the world. All hotels have a telephone in the room where you can make local, intercity, interstate or international calls. If you need a local mobile SIM Card it is possible to get one in one of the majors mobile company shops in Brazil: Claro, Tim or Vivo.
 
Internet services are available everywhere in Brazil.  Most hotels include high speed Internet access in the room.  Additionally, most cafes, restaurants and shopping malls offer free wi-fi services. 

### Tips and service gratuities

In Brazil, tips are usually added in 10% over bills involving servers such as bars and restaurants. Although a 10% service charge is automatically placed in the final bill, it is not mandatory. 

In hotels, you should tip the bell boy on an average of 5,00 BRL per bag. For others services, such as cab drivers and barber shops you don’t need to tip.

### Weather

Brasília has a subtropical climate. Its dry season runs from April to September, while the wet season increases humidity from October to March. The average temperature is 20.5 ºC (68.9 F).

## Tourist information

### The City

Open in 1960, Brasília and the Federal District were created to house the new capital of Brazil replacing Rio de Janeiro. Under the visionary leadership of President Juscelino Kubitschek, architect Oscar Niemeyer, urban planner Lucio Costa and landscape architect Burle Marx, Brasilia was conceived as a workable, utopic answer to modern, urban chaos.

Many have lauded the purpose-built city for its futuristic architecture and avant-garde design, and it is the first city constructed in the 20th century to achieve a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage designation.

Its modern architecture and harmonious contrast between green vegetation and concrete make Brasilia a unique city and destination. The main Niemeyer´s attractions are the National Congress, the Planalto Palace, the Justice Palace, the Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasilia and the TV Tower. Other prominent places in the city are the Lady Sarah Kubitschek City Park and the Paranoá Lake.

### The Nature

```
Located in the heart of Brazil, Brasilia is surrounded by the _Cerrado biome,_ which guards unbelievable natural beauties. The Cerrado is the world’s most biologically rich savanna, containing more than 10,000 species of plants, 45% of which are endemic. The Cerrado stretches across nearly 500 million acres of Brazil—an area nearly three times the size of Texas. The Cerrado also feeds three of the major water basins in South America: the Amazon, Paraguay and São Francisco Rivers.

The Cerrado is home to 935 species of birds and nearly 300 mammals, including such endangered species as cerrado fox, giant anteater, jaguar and maned wolf. 

The climate is dry, and the trees are twisted. During the day, it’s hot, but at night, the cold weather is pleasant. The Cerrado is without doubt one of the most beautiful Brazilian biomes. For those who like to be in contact with nature, the Chapada dos Veadeiros and the city of Pirenópolis are two must-see refuges near Brasília.

The excursion on 28 October will visit the bioma Cerrado.
